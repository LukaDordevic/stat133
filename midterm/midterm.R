#### Midterm in Statistics 133 Lecture 1 Fall 2014
#### Tuesday October 21st 2014
#### Good Luck!
present = T
#### Note:  Please use the EXACT variable names provided in the instructions.
####        The variable name is provided within double square brackets, e.g. [[ x ]]
####        The square brackets are simply there as a visual aide, so that you can quickly find it.
  
#### Note:  Remember to save your work during the test
####        Keep a terminal window open and do a [git add .] early
####        Then do [git commit -m "message"] and [git push] at the end, and preferably once or twice during the exam.

########################################### FIRST PART
#### We will start with a few small tasks.

## In one R command, create a variable [[ x ]] which is a vector and has
## all the even numbers between 2 and 20, in increasing order.

x=seq(2, 20, by=2)

## In one R command, create a variable [[ y ]] which is a vector and has
## all the odd numbers between -1 and -19, in decreasing order

y=seq(-1, -19,by= -2)

## In one R command, create a variable [[ z ]] which is a vector and has
## the numbers 1 through 5, each repeated 4 times, in order (so 1 1 1 1 2 2 2 2 etc.)

z= as.numeric(sapply(1:5, function(var) rep(var, 4)))

## In one R command, create a variable [[ m ]] that is a 3-by-4 matrix and has
## the entries 10, 20, through 120, where the numbers are entered row by row
## (so the first row is [ 10 20 30 40 ]).

m=matrix( seq(10, 120, by=10) , nrow=3, ncol=4)

## Create a variable [[ n ]] that is a data frame of dimension 10 x 3
## where the first column is the numbers 1-10, the second column the letters a-j and the
## third column has T/F, T if the number in column 1 is even, F if the number in column 1 is odd.
## Then add the column names :  num, lett, even

num=(1:10)
lett =  letters[seq( 1, 10)]
even.f = function(var){
  sapply(var, function(var2) (var %%2 ==0))
  
}
even =  (even.f(1:10))[,length(num)]


n = data.frame(num, lett, even)

## Create a variable [[ p ]] that is a list and whose elements are x, y, z and m from above.

p = list(x, y, z, m)

## Create a variable [[ nmat ]] that is a matrix of size 100 x 100 and whose
## elements are drawn from a Normal distribution with mean 6 and sd 2
## Do not remove the set.seed command
set.seed(42)

nmat = matrix( rnorm(10000, mean=6, sd=2), nrow=100, ncol=100)

########################################### SECOND PART

## Load in the rainfall data, the file is in the same directory as this test.
## You should get two objects, rain and day.
load("rainfallCO.rda")

## Extract the type of the variable rain and store in [[ type.rain ]]

type.rain = class(rain)

## Extract the names of the elements in rain and store in  [[ name.stations ]]

name.stations = names(rain)

## In one R command create the variable [[ n.obs ]] , a vector which stores the number
## of observations at EACH of the stations in rains


n.obs = sapply(rain, length)

## In one R command create the variable [[ max.rain ]] which stores the maximum
## rainfall for each weather station.

max.rain = lapply( rain, max)

## Plot a boxplot that shows the distribution of rainfall at each station
## (hint: there should be 5 "boxes" in the boxplot)


boxplot(rain)


## Make a scatterplot that shows the rainfall at station 1 in year 2000.
## Precipitation should go on the y-axis and day on the x-axis
## Make new labels for the x- and y-axis.
## Hint: the date information is stored in the object day.


plot(rain$st050183[9488:9699], xlab="Days in year 2000", ylab="Participation")


########################################### THIRD PART
#### Load in the infant data
load("KaiserBabies.rda")

## Let us do a linear regression of birth weight (bwt) as a function of the length
## of the pregnancy
## make sure to keep this line:

fit <- lm(bwt ~ gestation, data=infants)

## The object fit is a list and in it you will find the coefficients of the regression
## Do a scatterplot of birthweight (on y-axis) vs. gestation (on x-axis)
## Add to the plot the line estimated in fit (hint: find the coefficients)
## Plot the line in red and put your own x- and y-axis labels on the plot.


plot(infants$gestation, infants$bwt, xlab="Gestation", ylab="Birthweight", main="Gestation against Birthdweight")
abline(-10.0642, 0.4643, col="red")



## Plot a histogram of the fathers' heights (varible dht in the data frame).

hist(infants$dht, main="Father's height")


## Create a table which tallies the education level of mothers (varible ed in the data frame)
## against the education level of the fathers (variable ded in the data frame)

table(infants$ed, infants$ded)


########################################### FOURTH PART
## Write a function that takes as input a vector x and returns a standardized vector
## (i.e. x after subtracting the mean and dividing with the sd)

standardize <- function(x){
mean.x = mean(x)
sd.x = sd(x)
return (( x - mean.x)/sd.x)
}
